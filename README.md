## Introduction
This repo is the official implementation for the paper "Image Clustering via the Principle of Rate Reduction in the Age of Pretrained Models".
This paper proposes a novel image clustering pipeline that integrates pre-trained models and rate reduction, enhancing clustering accuracy and introducing an effective self-labeling algorithm for unlabeled datasets at scale.

## Install Dependencies
We adopt the pretrained CLIP model from OpenAI's official repository https://github.com/openai/CLIP. To install all the dependencies, run the following command:
```python
pip inatall -r requirements.txt
```
